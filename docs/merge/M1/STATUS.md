Both histories are reachable from the merge commit. `git log --first-parent` walks pls4all history; `git log` (default = follow all parents) walks both.

## Roadmap gate satisfied

> M1 gate per `MERGE_ROADMAP.md` row M1: *"both symbol tables co-exist; ctest can build pls4all only at this stage"*

- Both ABI symbol tables coexist on disk: pls4all `p4a_*` + donor `n4m_*` (each in its own header tree)
- pls4all builds and tests at 265/265 green
- Donor tree is dormant — neither pls4all's `CMakeLists.txt` nor any other build glue picks it up yet. That's correct for M1; M2.5 will start consolidating the common-core under `cpp/src/core/common/`.

## What is NOT done (intentionally, per the roadmap)

- Donor tree's CMakeLists not wired into pls4all's build (M2.5 will start that)
- No source moves yet (M3 moves donor non-PLS sources out from `_donor/` to final paths; M4 splits pls4all's `model.cpp` etc.)
- No ABI rename (M5)
- No catalog yet (M2 lands it)

## Untracked working-tree noise

~596 files showing as `??` in `git status`. These are leftover oracle dumps + `.x_target/` from the earlier `codex/parity-30x30-dashboard-fixes` checkout. They are NOT tracked by any branch — they are just orphan files on disk. They will be cleaned up either:
- by checking out a clean state after work resumes, or
- by the M2 catalog scripts when they run their own `.gitignore` propagation

No impact on the merge or build.

## Next: M2 — target tree skeleton

- Create the namespaced category dirs (per `MERGE_ROADMAP.md` §2)
- Land `catalog/schema/method_v1.json` (the expanded schema from §5.4)
- Auto-generate `catalog/methods.yaml` from both source trees
- Land the 7 subset YAMLs (2 active: `nirs4all_methods` + `pls4all`; 5 planned: `aompls`, `nirs4all_preprocessing`, `nirs4all_augmentation`, `nirs4all_selection`, `n4m_transfer`)
- Write `catalog/scripts/{validate_catalog,build_closure,render_subset}.py`
- Gate: `validate_catalog.py` passes; the two active subsets close
